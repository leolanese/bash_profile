# .bash_profile 

> UPDATED: Including `zsh` & `oh my zsh`

## What is the `.bash_profile`

bash_profile is a configuration file for bash shell. When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell it first reads and executes commands from: 

### Shortcut

```js
open -e ~/.bash_profile
nano ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

open -e ~/.zshrc
nano ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Why common `.bash_profile`
The idea is to share best practices, suggestions, tricks and keep the same profile across multiple development platforms easily cloning from the repository.

## zsh and .bash

> Both `bash` and `zsh` (OSX default) are popular Unix shells, but they have different configuration files and some distinct features. When we talk about `.bash_profile` and `.zshrc`, we are referring to the "startup files" (or configuration files) used by these shells.

### Startup Files:

#### bash

```js
~/.bash_profile: Read and executed only by login shells.
~/.bashrc: Read and executed by non-login shells (like when you open a new terminal tab).
In many setups, ~/.bash_profile sources (or includes) ~/.bashrc to ensure commands and settings are consistent across login and non-login shells.
```

#### zsh
```js
~/.zshrc: This is the primary configuration file for interactive use of zsh. It's analogous to ~/.bashrc in bash.
~/.zprofile: Read before .zshrc during a login, similar to .bash_profile in bash.
```

### Determinate what I'm currently using

```js
echo $SHELL
```

## The `.zsh`

Apple has changed the default shell to `zsh`. Therefore you have to rename your configuration files: `.bashrc` is now `.zshrc` and `.bash_profile` is now `.zprofile`.

```js
nano ~/.zshrc
```

> If you for some reason (like me) don't want to rename/move the `~/.bash_profile` file you can do the next things:

```js
// having a copy of `.bash_profile` and `.zprofile`
edit_p
cp ~/.bash_profile ~/.zprofile
source ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Getting the `.zsh`
You can use it with or without Catalina+ OSX, and also in combination of the normal terminal.

### Instalation
```js
// install zsh
sudo apt install zsh

// Make default shell set and logout
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

```js
// If you want to make zsh our default shell
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### oh my zsh
```js
// install oh my zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### Themes
// In order to enable a theme, set ZSH_THEME to the name of the theme in your: `~/.zshrc` (open ~/.zshrc). Then edit the: `ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"` based on any theme from: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes then: reload .zshrc:

```js
// reload zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

```js
// example themes
ZSH_THEME="bira"
ZSH_THEME="dallas"
ZSH_THEME="half-life"
ZSH_THEME="aussiegeek"
ZSH_THEME="avit"
```

### Pluggins

Choose from the list: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins
add the `plugin` to your plugins array in `~/.zshrc` (SHIFT, cmd, .) view all files there, paste plugin into plugin folder. Standard plugins can be found in `$ZSH/plugins/`

```js
// example
plugins=(vscode zsh_reload git)
```

## System Operation Versions

### MAC version:
A typical install of OSX won't create a `.bash_profile` for you. When you want to run functions from your command line, this is a must-have.

#### Setup Startup Terminal with .bash
```js
// go to your home folder
cd ~/

// create your new file if you don't have it
touch .bash_profile

// open with textEditor or nano
open -e ./bash_profile
nano ./bash_profile
```

#### Alternative modificaton 

> If we need to inject just a line we could use `>>`

```js
echo "alias python='python2.7'" >> ~/.zshrc
```

---

## Commands and alliases:

### edit bash_profile

```js
open -e ~/.bash_profile
```

### if you don't have this file, create it!
```js
touch ~/.bash_profile
```

## Windows version

> Note: `Use double quotes instead of single one`!!

```js
git config --global alias.ci "commit -v"

git config --global alias.log "log --pretty=oneline"

git config --global alias.log1 "log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"
```
