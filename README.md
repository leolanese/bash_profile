# .bash_profile

## [UPDATE] Catalina+ OSX
Apple has changed the default shell to `zsh`. Therefore you have to rename your configuration files: `.bashrc` is now `.zshrc` and `.bash_profile` is now `.zprofile`.

> If you for some reason (like me) don't want to rename/move the `~/.bash_profile` file you can do the next things:

```js
cp ~/.bash_profile ~/.zprofile
source ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.zshrc
```

## What to have `.zsh`
You can use it with or without Catalina+ OSX, and also in combination of the normal terminal.

### Instalation
```js
## install zsh
sudo apt install zsh

## Make default shell set and logout
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### oh my zsh
```js
// isntall oh my zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### Themes
In order to enable a theme, set ZSH_THEME to the name of the theme in your:
`~/.zshrc` (open ~/.zshrc). Then edit the: `ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"` based on any theme from: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes then: reload .zshrc:

```js
// reload zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

```js
// example themes
ZSH_THEME="bira"
ZSH_THEME="dallas"
ZSH_THEME="half-life"
ZSH_THEME="aussiegeek"
ZSH_THEME="avit"
```

### Pluggins

Choose from the list: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins
add the `plugin` to your plugins array in `~/.zshrc` (SHIFT, cmd, .) view all files there, paste plugin into plugin folder. Standard plugins can be found in `$ZSH/plugins/`

```js
// example
plugins=(vscode zsh_reload git)
```

## What is the `.bash_profile`
bash_profile is a configuration file for bash shell. When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell it first reads and executes commands from ~/. bash_profile.


## Why common `.bash_profile`
The idea is to share best practices, suggestions, tricks and keep the same profile across multiple development platforms easily cloning from the repository.

# System Operation Versions

## MAC version:
A typical install of OSX won't create a .bash_profile for you.
When you want to run functions from your command line, this is a must-have.

## Setup Startup Terminal
`Type`: "cd ~/" to go to your home folder
`Type`: "touch .bash_profile" to create your new file.
`Edit`: .bash_profile with your favorite editor (or you can just type "open -e .bash_profile" to open it in TextEdit.
`Type`: ". .bash_profile" to reload .bash_profile and update any functions you add (reload by the system)

### Commands and alliases:

### edit bash_profile
```
open -e ~/.bash_profile
```

### if you don't have this file, create it!

```
